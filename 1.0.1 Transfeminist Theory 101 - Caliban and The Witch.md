Caliban and the Witch: Women, the Body, and Primitive Accumulation [EN pdf](https://files.libcom.org/files/Caliban%20and%20the%20Witch.pdf) [FR pdf](https://entremonde.net/IMG/pdf/18rupture-caliban-et-la-sorciere-web.pdf) is a book written by 2nd wave feminist Silvia Federici and published in 2004. Despite some of Federici's later publishings, this novel is decidedly a baseline classic of feminist theory. Rooted in Marxist theory, she looks to uncover the history of colonialist patriarchal misogyny since the middle ages based on her experiences in Nigeria.
